<h1> HELLO PUNY MORTALS! I SELL PIE!!!</h1>
<p>Did you really think that I sell pie? 'Cause you're right! I sell various types of pie. Apple pie, cherry pie, blueberry pie, anything you can think of! :D I haven't got <i>that</i> many types, so yeah, please tell me if you'd want any other types of pie.</p>
<p>Apple pie-$1</p>
<p>Cherry pie-$2</p>
<p>Blueberry pie-$1</p>
<p>Blackberry pie-$1</p>
<p>Pumpkin pie-3$(This pie is popular, that's why the price is higher)</p>
<p>Rasberry pie-2$</p>

<p>But you can't use your <i>real</i> money. No, I have a system here! ;) But for this, you need to have some pi. 
I mean <i>pi</i> pi. As in 3.14159265359.</p> 
<p>For every digit of pi you memorize, you earn 50 cents. So if you memorize 3.14, you have $1.50. 3.14159265359 would be $6. 
Yes, you would be able to afford several pies quickly. But if this website has more visitors, I'll raise the prices. </p>
<p>I'll put down your names right under, with how much money you have. If you want to get more money because you can't memorize any more, just calculate more pi, all by hand. Show your work and all your digits. Thank you! </p>
